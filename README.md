# Deep Generative Replay 
### Mimicking Human Continual Learning in a Neural Network

A project built around the framework proposed in: [Continual Learning with Deep Generative Replay](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.08690.pdf). The goal of this approach is to develop a single model that can achieve high accuracy on two independent tasks.
